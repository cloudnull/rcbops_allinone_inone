Run an RCBOPS All In One Deployment In One Server
=================================================


General Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I made this script such that you can stand up an Openstack based on Rackspace Private Cloud Software in minutes and play with it. This is a VERY simple script which will build you an environment based on the Rackspace Private Cloud Software. This script is presently using the v4.1.2 TAG by default from the rcbops-cookbooks repo : (https://github.com/rcbops/chef-cookbooks) though an override can be set to use any and all RCBOPS releases. This script only works on Ubuntu servers.


This script will install the following:

* Openstack Controller
* Openstack Compute
* Horizon
* Cinder
* Nova-Network
* ubuntu 12.04 LTS Image
* Cirros Image
* Fedora Image
* Ubuntu Image
* Qemu is used for the Virt Driver
* The Latest Stable Chef Server
* Chef Client
* Knife


========


Configuration Options
